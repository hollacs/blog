### My AMXX Adventure: A Wobbly Yet Heartfelt Journey

#### "Zombie Mode": The Spark That Lit My World
My love affair with AMXX all started when I first dipped my toes into *Counter-Strike* (CS). <!--more--> Back then, I was totally clueless about picking servers and just wandered around aimlessly. That’s when I stumbled into this super cool zombie mode server called "tig." Oh my gosh, the moment I joined, it was like stepping into a whole new universe! It was inspired by *Resident Evil*, with all these fierce bosses from RE2 and RE3, plus a dash of *Left 4 Dead* vibes. When I saw a zombie blasting humans with a rocket launcher, I was totally floored, like, “No way, this is too epic!” The fast, thrilling gameplay with that spooky atmosphere had me completely hooked. Later, I found out the server owner coded it with AMXX, and my heart just lit up. One person could create something *this* amazing? I was like, “I *have* to try this!” And just like that, I dove headfirst into the AMXX world.

Here’s a super old video from TiG that brings back all the feels:

#### First Server Glow-Up: So Much Fun, Then Total Chaos
I started playing around with AMXX, picking up its tricky syntax little by little until I could whip up some cute scripts. Feeling all inspired, I tweaked a Zombie Plague (ZP) plugin, dreaming of making the Zombie Boss and Human Leader as fabulous as the ones in "tig." I added special attack moves for zombies and shiny new weapons for humans. When it finally worked, I was over the moon, like, “Am I actually kind of awesome?!” Launching the server was so exciting, and it even drew in a few players! I got carried away and added a leveling system so everyone could upgrade and grab rewards for fighting zombies. Soon, more people joined, and at its busiest, the server was bursting with 32 players! Some even messaged me, saying, “This mode is so fun!” My heart was soaring, and I’d stay up late watching everyone play, dreaming up ways to make it even better. But, ugh, my perfectionist side got *way* too extra. I kept wanting to add more stuff—like fancy weapon effects or super detailed maps—until my code turned into a total mess, like a drawer full of tangled yarn. Plus, I’m such a procrastinator, always thinking, “It’s not perfect yet,” so I’d put off fixing things. Slowly, players got bored and left, and my server went quiet. I was too drained to keep going.

#### Quiet Little Experiments
Even when things looked calm on the outside, my heart was still buzzing. One day, a dear friend who totally changed my life mentioned that CS was written in C++. That got me curious, and I realized I’d been cozy in my little AMXX bubble for too long. I needed to explore deeper! So, I started nibbling at C++ and even wandered into NPC AI pathfinding. I’m such a curious soul, so I just *had* to try something. After some wild tinkering, I actually got a tiny thing to work! But, oh my, the code was like a messy closet, and even I got dizzy looking at it. My confidence was super shaky, and I kept thinking, “This is probably terrible,” so I left it half-done. Still, those little experiments gave me a sweet peek into the techy world.

#### The Lows: CS Faded, and So Did My Spark
Later, I got this big burst of energy and decided to go all out, spending a whole year building a zombie server from scratch. My heart was so full of dreams, thinking this time I’d create something *amazing*. I’d even dream up new ideas while sleeping! But my perfectionism crashed the party again. I kept fussing over every little detail, thinking, “This isn’t good enough,” or “That could be better.” My procrastination didn’t help, and I’d spend forever tweaking things. When I finally launched the server, I sat there, heart pounding, imagining players rushing in. I even pictured adding fun new features to surprise them. But reality was so harsh. CS wasn’t popular anymore, and no matter how many nights I waited, the server stayed empty—not one player showed up. My heart sank so low, like all my hard work was for nothing. I started overthinking: “Did I start too late? Does nobody like what I made?” Those days, I felt like I’d hit rock bottom, barely able to even look at my computer.

#### Bouncing Back: Tiny Wins, Lingering Doubts
Even after CS faded, I couldn’t just let it go—my heart wouldn’t let me. So, I went back to my NPC experiments, this time with way more focus. I poured hours into smoothing out pathfinding and even made a little video to show off my work. Watching my NPC zip around on screen made my heart sing, and I secretly thought, “Wow, I’m kinda cool!” But soon, I realized NPCs were *way* trickier than I thought. Besides pathfinding, there were so many other things to figure out, like making them smarter or handling different situations. My confidence started wobbling again, and I felt like I’d never get it right, so I paused it once more.

#### Gritty Breakthrough: From Mess to Magic
I’m the kind of girl who can’t let go of something she loves, so I kept circling back. During those low moments, I kept thinking about AMXX’s big flaw: too much code turned into a total jumble, like old PHP with zero organization. One day, chatting with my friend, we got this wild idea: what if we brought object-oriented programming (OOP) to AMXX to make it organize better? I was so excited that I jumped in and coded a version with pure amxx right away. It worked, but the performance was *so* slow, like a sleepy snail. I started panicking, thinking, “Oh no, did I mess this up too?” But I wasn’t ready to give up. I told my friend the speed was a problem, and asked if modules could help. He’s the best and whipped up a test version that runs *so* much faster. My heart felt so much lighter, like, “Maybe I can really do this!”

#### Maintenance Struggles: Tough but Worth It
After the module was ready, my friend gave me a sweet pat on the back and said, “You’ve got this!” I thought I was ready, but oh my gosh, maintenance was *hard*. To figure out how it all worked, I even tried learning Assembly Language, which felt like reading a secret code from another planet. With my shaky confidence, I wanted to shut my pc and run away so many times. But my perfectionist heart wouldn’t let me quit—I *had* to understand it. After dragging my feet forever, I didn’t fully get it, but I managed to stabilize the module. Along the way, I learned so much about modules and OOP, and I started to see how to make my code all neat and tidy. It was a tough road, but it made me fall a little more in love with tech.

#### Me Today: Still Chasing My Childhood Dreams
Looking back, this wobbly journey wouldn’t have happened without my amazing friend. From C++ to OOP, he always gave me a gentle nudge, saving me from my procrastination and self-doubt. I’m still tinkering with this OOP framework, hoping to bring back the magic of the "tig" mode. Those rocket-launcher zombies and epic boss battles still dance in my mind, making me so nostalgic. Honestly, I still wonder if I can really do it, but there’s this little spark in my heart that refuses to fade. I also want to pick up my NPC research again, believing those old ideas could bloom into something even better. My perfectionist soul keeps pushing me to make things the best they can be, so no matter how long this path is, I’m ready to keep twirling along.
