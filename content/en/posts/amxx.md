### My AMXX Journey: Stumbling but Stubborn

#### Zombie Mode: The Spark That Started It All

My AMXX story began when I was a kid, obsessed with *Counter-Strike* (CS 1.6). I was a total newbie, but one day I found a server called “tig” on a forum. It sounded cool, so I joined. Wow, was I blown away! The server was inspired by *Resident Evil*, with bosses from the games and a bit of *Left 4 Dead*’s vibe. When I saw a zombie boss blasting humans with a rocket launcher, I was shocked, thinking, “This is wild!” The fast battles and creepy mood kept me hooked. Later, I learned the server’s creator used AMXX to build it all. That lit a fire in me: one person could make something this awesome? I wanted to try too! So, I jumped into AMXX.

Here’s a classic TiG video to remember those exciting days:

#### First Server: A Fun Start, Then a Mess

I started learning AMXX from scratch, struggling with its messy code until I could write simple scripts. Then, I decided to make my own zombie server using a popular plugin called Zombie Plague. I wanted the zombie king and human leader to be as cool as TiG’s, with special attacks for zombies and stronger weapons for humans. When the code finally worked, I was so excited! The server went online, and a few players joined. I added a leveling system so players could earn rewards by fighting zombies, and more people came. At its best, all 32 spots filled up fast, and someone even said, “This is awesome!” I was thrilled, spending every day thinking of ways to improve the game.

But I’m a perfectionist, and that caused trouble. I kept adding new weapons, fancy effects, and tricky maps. The code became a huge mess, and I couldn’t even understand it. I also procrastinated, thinking nothing was good enough, so I stopped updating. Players got bored and left. Soon, the server was empty, and I gave up.

#### Quiet but Still Curious

I seemed to move on, but I still felt a pull. One day, a friend who inspired me said CS was built with C++. That clicked something in me: AMXX was too small. I wanted to learn more. I asked him to teach me C++, and he patiently explained everything, from simple code to tough stuff like memory management. Even when I was confused, he used easy examples to help me understand. With his support, I started playing with NPC pathfinding. I messed around and made a small program that worked! The code was awful, like a junk pile, but it got me excited about deeper tech. Still, I doubted myself, thought it wasn’t good enough, and quit halfway.

#### The Low Point: Dreams Meet Reality

Later, I got motivated again and decided to spend a year building a new zombie server. I was full of ideas, even thinking of features while sleeping, sure I’d make something amazing. But my perfectionism and procrastination got in the way. I kept changing things, thinking it wasn’t good enough, and it took forever to finish. When the server launched, I was nervous but hopeful, imagining players rushing in. I even planned extra features if they liked it. But CS wasn’t popular anymore. I waited for days, but no one came. It felt like my heart broke, like all my work was pointless. I wondered if I started too late or if my server was just bad. I felt so low, I didn’t even want to touch my computer.

#### Trying Again: Small Wins, New Challenges

Even with CS fading, I didn’t want to give up. I went back to NPCs, this time more serious. I worked hard on pathfinding and made videos to show my progress. Seeing NPCs move on the screen made me so happy—I felt like I was getting somewhere. But NPCs were harder than I thought. Besides pathfinding, I had to figure out AI and different situations, which was overwhelming. I lost confidence again, thinking I’d never get it right, so I stopped.

#### Breakthrough by Pushing Through

I’m stubborn, though—I always pick things back up. During that tough time, I complained about AMXX’s problems: too much code made it a mess, like old PHP with no structure. One day, my friend suggested something crazy: could we make AMXX work like object-oriented programming (OOP) to fix it? I got excited and built a version with pure amxx. It worked, but it runs super slow. I panicked, worried I’d failed again. I told my friend it runs too slow, and he helped by making a test module that ran way faster. I felt hopeful, like we could really do this.

#### The Hard Work of Keeping It Going

After the module was done, my friend said it was up to me. I thought I could handle it, but it was tough. To understand it, I studied Assembly Language, which was like reading alien writing. I wanted to quit so many times because I doubted myself. But my perfectionism made me keep going. It took a long time, and I didn’t fully get it, but the module finally worked better. It was hard, but I learned a lot about modules and OOP, and I started writing cleaner code.

#### Where I Am Now: Chasing My Kid Dreams

Looking back, my friend’s support kept me going. From C++ to OOP, he pushed me past my doubts and laziness, or I’d have given up. I’m still working on that OOP system, hoping to bring back TiG’s magic—zombie boss with rocket launchers, epic boss fights, and crazy battles. Those memories still make me smile. I sometimes doubt I can do it, but that spark from when I was a kid is still there. I haven’t given up on NPCs either—I think I can make them better. My perfectionism makes me want everything to be great, so no matter how long it takes, I’ll keep going.
